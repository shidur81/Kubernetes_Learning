# What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source system for managing containers. So…what are containers? Containers are basically a piece of software plus all the stuff it needs to run, all gathered up in a lightweight package. Containers support “microservices” by breaking larger applications up into smaller, more manageable bits. With this modular approach, containers let DevOps teams divide and conquer, shrinking development and testing times.
